classify decides WITHOUT calling a model whether the review runs and at which tier
("light" or "full"), from the `git diff --numstat` of the PR, its branch kind, labels and
draft state, against the thresholds in the config. It prints the decision with its reason
and, under GitHub Actions, writes run/tier/model/max_turns/reason to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and a
line to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, so a skipped review is never silent.

review runs `claude -p` (Claude Code in print mode) with the API key in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
the tier's model, turn and budget limits, read-only tools and a JSON schema for the findings,
and writes the CLI's JSON result to --out. It hands the model the PR diff with the new-file
line number in front of every line, so the model can cite lines GitHub accepts. Why it runs
`claude -p` and not anthropics/claude-code-action: see the note below. The model only reads;
posting is done here.

post turns the findings into one PR review with inline comments on changed lines, and keeps
one summary comment per PR up to date (edited in place). A finding whose line is not part of
the diff cannot be an inline comment; it is listed in the summary instead, and the
inline/summary-only counts are logged. --dry-run prints the payloads and posts nothing.

cost reads the result record (the `claude -p` JSON result, or an Agent SDK message list) and
reports the API cost in USD, the token counts, turns and duration as the CLI recorded them.
A missing or unparsable record is an error (exit 1), not a silent zero.
